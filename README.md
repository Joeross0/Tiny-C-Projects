# Tiny C++ Projects

This repository is a collection of C++ projects that I am building to learn the language. Over time, it will grow into a compilation of random ideas that can be used to build other projects and potentially inspire others to do the same. My background is in C#, so while I understand some of the syntax, there is still a lot to learn!

## Projects Roadmap

1. **Calculator**
   - A simple command-line calculator that can handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Future Project Ideas

2. **Guess the Number Game**
   - A terminal-based game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it with feedback (higher/lower).

3. **To-Do List Application**
   - A console application to manage tasks with features to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

4. **File I/O Project**
   - A project demonstrating file reading and writing operations, which could involve a small log manager or note-taker program.

5. **Basic Bank Account System**
   - Create a simple bank account system that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check balances.

6. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - A basic terminal-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.

7. **Hangman Game**
   - A word-guessing game where the user must guess the letters in a word before a certain number of incorrect guesses.

8. **Prime Number Finder**
   - A program that finds all prime numbers up to a certain limit.

9. **Temperature Converter**
   - Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with a simple command-line tool.

10. **Random Password Generator**
    - A program that generates strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria (length, inclusion of special characters, etc.).

11. **Maze Generator and Solver**
    - Create a random maze and implement an algorithm to solve it using breadth-first search or depth-first search.

12. **Simple Text-Based Adventure Game**
    - Build an interactive story game where users make choices that affect the outcome of the game.

13. **Student Grade Calculator**
    - Input grades for a student and calculate the overall grade with various weights for assignments, quizzes, and exams.

14. **Roman Numeral Converter**
    - Convert between Roman numerals and integers.

15. **Matrix Calculator**
    - Implement basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
